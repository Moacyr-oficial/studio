## Core Features:

- Code Generation: Generate Bedrock Edition addon code snippets based on user input, using a generative AI tool to reason about which Minecraft features or syntax should be incorporated.
- Code Editor: Display generated or converted code in a structured, editable format.
- Documentation Access: Implement a search feature to access available Minecraft Bedrock documentation.
- Version Control: Implement version control to allow users to revert to previous versions of generated addons.
- Examples Display: Display example addon packs with source codes to assist user learning.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Use a light-to-medium gray (e.g., #F2F2F2) for the main background, similar to Gemini.
- Secondary color: White (#FFFFFF) for cards, input fields, and areas requiring emphasis.
- Accent color: Use a combination of blue, red, yellow, and green (e.g. #4285F4, #DB4437, #F4B400, #0F9D58) as highlights, mimicking the Gemini color scheme. Use these sparingly to indicate loading, interactive elements, or important status indicators.
- Text color: Dark gray or black (#212121) for primary text to ensure readability against the light backgrounds.
- Headline font: 'Google Sans' or similar geometric sans-serif font for headings, titles, and larger text elements.
- Body font: 'Roboto' or 'Arial' for body text, code descriptions, and documentation.
- Code font: 'Source Code Pro' or 'Menlo' for displaying code snippets, ensuring monospace consistency.
- Use Material Design icons: Employ simple, outlined icons from the Material Design library to maintain a clean and recognizable look.
- Use a card-based layout: Organize content into cards with rounded corners and subtle shadows to create a layered effect. Cards can contain code snippets, documentation, or settings.
- Implement a split-screen or tabbed interface: Use split-screen for simultaneous code editing and preview, or tabbed interface to switch between different functionalities.
- Subtle loading animations: Use a rotating circle or progress bar with the accent colors during code generation or format conversion to indicate activity.
- Smooth transitions: Apply subtle fade or slide transitions when switching between sections or displaying new content to enhance the user experience.
